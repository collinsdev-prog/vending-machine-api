# VASCON Code Challenge

A full-stack vending machine system built with **NestJS** (Backend) and **Next.js/React** (Frontend). This solution provides role-based functionality where **Sellers** can manage products and **Buyers** can deposit coins and make purchases.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project implements a vending machine API and web interface with the following core capabilities:

- Role-based access control (`buyer`, `seller`)
- Product management (CRUD for sellers)
- Coin deposit, purchase, and change calculation
- JWT-based authentication
- Session management with multi-device awareness
- Fullstack architecture using modern technologies

⚠️ Edge Cases Considered
Insufficient deposit on purchase

Product out of stock

Invalid coin denominations

Session hijacking / multi-login enforcement

Unauthorized access to restricted resources

🧪 Postman Collection
A Postman collection is available locally for validating all endpoints. Please request it during code review or testing.

📌 Bonus Feature
🔄 Multi-device session detection and termination (/logout/all)

🛡️ Strong focus on access control and endpoint protection

⏱️ Timeline
Total time for completion: 7 days
Make sure to have the project running locally and a working Postman setup for demonstration.
